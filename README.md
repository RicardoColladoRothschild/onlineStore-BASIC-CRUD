# E-commerce

This project is build to practice backend and frontend.
I use a basic CRUD, where an user is able to purchase a product, and/or send it to a cart. 
Product in cart can be buy by the user, using a prestablish credit available for every new user, 
that is deducted every time a suer consume a product. 

## Page flow
First thing user see is a login view, where needs to put information, that information is requested to the backend, if
it match any previous data, it will go to the next page. 

## Backend
The backend directory holds all of the backend functionality:
* Server
* data base management
* clases
* handle events and others
